## UX 

### 1.1 Overview

* When beginning the project I knew I wanted to create an e-commerce website to showcase the earrings my partner has been making over lockdown. I like the idea of showcasing her products, but since she does not want to make her own website I wanted to use this project to display her work. I wanted to create a simple e-commerce website inspired by small businesses with a simple but bright colour scheme and minimalistic style. I wanted the website not to overshadow the products.

### 1.2 Project Goals

* The website is designed to look inviting but not overwhelming to allow the products to be the main draw. It has all the functionality you would expect from any e-commerce website, big or small. It also has the aesthetic of the website of a smaller business to appeal to people looking to shop smaller and more locally instead of supporting larger companies.

### 1.3 User Goals

* A user would want a simple homepage which is clear and easy to navigate.
* A user would want to be able to search for specific products.
* A user would want to be able to search in specific categories for desired products.
* A user would want to be aware of any new products or special deals.
* A user would want to be able to register an account to keep track of products in their basket and purchases. 
* A user would want to be able to login to their account and logout when they are finished.
* A user would want their cart to be updated as they add products so what they are purchasing is visible and the price is updated.

## Features

### 2.1 Navigation Bar

* The Navbar is consistent across ever page of the site with the same colour scheme and the same functionality. 
* The logo in the top corner will always link back to the home page, allowing the user easily navigate back to the home page.
* The Navbar contains a search bar which will allow the user to search for keywords which appear in product name or description. 
* Underneath the search bar there are dropdown boxes which act as category selectors and will filter products based on the selected attributes.
* The My Profile button allows the to access their own profile and view their previous orders as well as set a default address for the user.
* The cart symbol in the corner has an adaptive number underneath it which updates to show an accurate value to the users selected products, including product price and delivery cost. The cart will also change from a muted grey to black when any products have been added increasing the base value above 0.00. 

### 2.2 Search Bar

* The search bar is a simple search function which is easy to navigate for the user.
* Entering a search term will display the products whose description or name contain the search term.
* This will filter all products regardless of category, so long as they contain the search term within their description or name.

### 2.3 Category Selection

* The user will also be able to use the category selection beneath the search bar.
* These categories will narrow down the products into one or multiple categories which are grouped together. In 'Classic Earrings' there are two subcategories of 'Single-Piece Earrings' and 'Multi-Piece Earrings' which can be displayed individually or together by selecting 'All Earrings'. In 'Offers' there are three subcategories of 'Summer Collection', 'Deals' and 'Clearance' which can be displayed individually or together by selecting 'All Offers'. Within 'All Items' all products will be displayed within a secondary filter which can be applied from the dropdown box including: 'By Price High-Low', 'By Price Low-High' and 'By Rating'. All of these filters can be applied to any products pages using another dropdown box present at the top of each product page.

### 2.4 Product Details

* Each product will link to its own product details page. The user is able to arrive at the product details page in one of three ways, by either selecting the product image, the product name or by clicking the more info button.
