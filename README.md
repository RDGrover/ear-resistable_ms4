## UX 

### 1.1 Overview

* When beginning the project I knew I wanted to create an e-commerce website to showcase the earrings my partner has been making over lockdown. I like the idea of showcasing her products, but since she does not want to make her own website I wanted to use this project to display her work. I wanted to create a simple e-commerce website inspired by small businesses with a simple but bright colour scheme and minimalistic style. I wanted the website not to overshadow the products.

### 1.2 Project Goals

* The website is designed to look inviting but not overwhelming to allow the products to be the main draw. It has all the functionality you would expect from any e-commerce website, big or small. It also has the aesthetic of the website of a smaller business to appeal to people looking to shop smaller and more locally instead of supporting larger companies.

### 1.3 User Goals

* A user would want a simple homepage which is clear and easy to navigate.
* A user would want to be able to search for specific products.
* A user would want to be able to search in specific categories for desired products.
* A user would want to be aware of any new products or special deals.
* A user would want to be able to register an account to keep track of products in their basket and purchases. 
* A user would want to be able to login to their account and logout when they are finished.
* A user would want their cart to be updated as they add products so what they are purchasing is visible and the price is updated.
